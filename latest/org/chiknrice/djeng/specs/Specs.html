    <p>
        a codec framework

    Problem
</h3><p>
    Communication protocols doesn't end in http. As a developer for payment systems, I'm often required to integrate
    with switches or POS terminals which doesn't communicate using web services. When developing communications
    adapters for different protocols, I came to realize that there is no one solution available to cover these
    requirements. Some frameworks exists but are usually focused on a specific format or protocol.
</p><h3>
    Solution
</h3><p>
    DJENG stands for Dynamic Java Encoder (NextGen). It is the next generation of byte stream codec framework. Although
    originally intended to be a framework for creating ISO8583/AS2805 codecs, it evolved into a dynamic framework to
    easily create a codec for any message format (e.g. HSM calls, SMPP messages).
</p><h3>
    Specifications
</h3><p>
    These specifications are living documentation (using <a href="http://concordion.org/">Concordion</a>) which defines
    the functionality of every component of djeng. Automated tests are performed when generating these documentation and
    results are reflected at every build. A test that fails would be marked in <span class="failure">red</span> and
    passing tests would be marked in <span class="success">green</span>.
</p><h3>
    Usage
</h3><p>
    The usual use cases involving codecs are sending and receiving messages. Sending messages involves building a
    message, encoding the message to a byte array using a codec, and finally sending that byte array through the wire.
    Receiving messages involves reading the bytes from the wire, decoding the bytes to a message using a codec and
    finally querying specific elements on the message.
</p><p>
    To build a codec, a <a href="config/Config.html" c:run="concordion" class="success">configuration</a> should first be created based
    on the message format. A message format would usually define the encoding, length, and order of every message
    element. With the configuration, the <a href="codec/Codec.html" c:run="concordion" class="success">message codec</a> can then be
    created which could be used (and re-used) for encoding and decoding <a href="message/Message.html" c:run="concordion" class="success">message</a>s.
