<h3>
    Data Structure
</h3>

<p>
    Any message can practically be represented as a hierarchical data structure and this is the same with a byte stream.
    Djeng provides the class <code>org.chiknrice.djeng.Message</code> for this purpose. Message elements are organized
    into a tree-like structure where the message is the root element which has a collection of sub elements. The sub
    elements can either be a value element or a composite element. Value elements would be placeholders for actual parts
    of the message while composite elements are collection of sub elements serving as the branches in the tree-like
    structure.

<h3>
    Message elements
</h3>

<p>
    Message provides methods to set, remove, and get elements. Set and remove methods are distinguished from each other
    as setting an element doesn't allow null values (one of the fundamental rules of the framework). Setting an elements
    is done via <code class="nowrap">void setElement(String indexPath, Object value)</code>, removing an element is done
    via <code class="nowrap">void removeElement(String indexPath)</code>, and getting an element value is done via <code
        class="nowrap">T getElement(String indexPath)</code>.
