<h3>
    Data Structure
</h3>

<p>
    Any message can practically be represented as a hierarchical data structure and this is the same with a byte stream.
    Djeng provides the class org.chiknrice.djeng.Message for this purpose. Message elements are organized into a
    tree-like structure where the message would be the root element represented as a collection of sub elements. The sub
    elements can either be a value element or a composite element. Value elements would be placeholders for actual parts
    of the message while composite elements are collection of sub elements serving as the branches in the tree-like
    structure.
</p>

<h3>
    Accessor/Mutator
</h3>

<p>
    <!-- TODO link to set/remove/get specifications -->
    Message provides methods to set, remove, and get elements. Set and remove methods are distinguished from each other
    as setting an element doesn't allow null values (one of the fundamental rules of the framework).
