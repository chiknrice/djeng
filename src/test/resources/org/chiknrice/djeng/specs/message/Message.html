<h1>Message</h1>

<p>
    The message (org.chiknrice.djeng.Message) uses a hierarchical model to represent the message elements in a byte
    stream. Message elements are organized into a tree-like structure. The message would be the root element which is
    represented as a collection of sub elements. The sub elements can either be a value element (leaf) or a composite
    element (branch). Each branch/composite element is again a collection of sub elements.
</p>

<p>
    <!-- TODO link to set/remove/get specifications -->
    Methods are provided to set, remove, and get elements. Set and remove methods are distinguished from each other as
    setting an element doesn't allow null values.
