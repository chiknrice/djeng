<p>
    DJENG stands for Dynamic Java Encoder (NextGen). It is the next generation of byte stream codec framework which is a
    product of another project, Jen8583. Although djeng was originally intended to as a framework for creating codecs to
    encoding/decoding ISO8583/AS2805 messages, it evolved into a dynamic framework which can be used to easily create a
    codec for any message format.
</p>

<p>
    The key components of djeng are the <a href="config/Config.html" c:run="concordion">xml configuration</a>,
    the <a href="codec/Codec.html" c:run="concordion">message codec</a> and the
    <a href="message/Message.html" c:run="concordion">message</a>. Message codecs are built based on the xml
    configuration defined by the user. These message codec then performs the heavy lifting of encoding/decoding between
    message and from byte arrays. Lastly, the message provides a way for users to query message elements after decoding
    a byte array and to build messages prior to encoding to byte arrays.
