    <p>
        a codec framework
    </p>

<h3>
    Problem
</h3>

<p>
    Communication protocols doesn't end in http. As a developer for payment systems, I'm often required to integrate
    with switches or POS terminals which doesn't communicate using web services. When developing communications
    adapters for different protocols, I came to realize that there is no one solution available to cover these
    requirements. Some frameworks exists but are usually focused on a specific format or protocol.
</p>

<h3>
    Solution
</h3>

<p>
    DJENG stands for Dynamic Java Encoder (NextGen). It is the next generation of byte stream codec framework. Although
    originally intended to be a framework for creating ISO8583/AS2805 codecs, it evolved into a dynamic framework to
    easily create a codec for any message format (e.g. HSM calls, SMPP messages).

<h3>
    Specifications
</h3>

<p>
    These specifications are living documentation (using <a href="http://concordion.org/">Concordion</a>) which defines
    the functionality of every component of djeng. Automated test results are reflected in these pages at every build. A
    test that fails would be marked in <span class="failure">red</span> and passing tests would be marked in
    <span class="success">green</span>.
</p>

<h3>
    Usage
</h3>

<p>
    One would generally define the <a href="config/Config.html" c:run="concordion">configuration</a> based on a
    particular message structure. The configuration is then used to build a message <a href="codec/Codec.html"
                                                                                       c:run="concordion">codec</a>
    to be used for encoding and decoding <a href="message/Message.html" c:run="concordion">message</a>.
