<h3>
    Problem
</h3>

<p>
    Communication protocols doesn't end in http. Having developed for different system integrators (including payment
    and mobile solutions), I'm often required to integrate different components including switches, POS terminals, and
    HSMs (hardware security module). These components typically communicate using different non-http protocols. One main
    aspect of a protocol is the message format. Different protocols usually have different message formats. When
    implementing codecs for different message formats, I realized that there's no single solution available that can
    cover all the different codec related requirements I have. Although some frameworks exists, they are usually focused
    on a specific message format. Different frameworks mean inconsistent approach, high learning curve for new
    developers, and hard to maintain code (just to name a few).
</p>

<h3>
    Solution
</h3>

<p>
    DJENG stands for Dynamic Java Encoder (NextGen). It is a protocol-agnostic byte stream codec framework. Although
    originally intended to be a framework for creating ISO8583/AS2805 codecs, it evolved into a dynamic framework to
    easily create a codec for any message format (e.g. HSM calls, SMPP messages). The core idea of djeng is to define a
    comprehensive encoding/decoding process, provide an API to develop codecs, and allow these codecs to be used in this
    encoding/decoding process. As a convenience, the framework is bundled with a set of codecs which serves as a
    reference implementation of the core API. The bundled codecs are commonly used in encoding/decoding financial
    messages but can be used to address a totally different problem. If none of the bundled codecs can cover a specific
    requirement, it's always easy to develop a new codec to implement this unusual encoding/decoding algorithm.

<h3>
    Specifications
</h3>

<p>
    The specifications are living documentation (@see <a href="http://concordion.org/">Concordion</a>). Automated tests
    are performed when generating these pages which in turn reflects the results of the tests. A test that fails would
    be shown in <span class="failure">red</span> and passing tests would be shown in <span class="success">green</span>.
    The high level results serves the purpose of links to more detailed specification. One can drill down by navigating
    to these links (try clicking on the message link below), while breadcrumbs are provided for navigating back to the
    higher level specification page.

<h3>
    Usage
</h3>

<p>
    The main use cases involving codecs are sending and receiving messages as byte streams. Sending messages starts with
    building a message, encoding that message to a byte array using a codec, and finally sending that byte array through
    the wire. Receiving messages starts with reading the bytes from the wire, decoding the bytes to a message using a
    codec and finally querying specific elements on the message.

<p>
    To be able to encode/decode any type of <a href="message/Message.html" c:run="concordion">message</a> the codec
    needs to be configurable. The framework provides a way to to define a message codec using an <a
        href="config/Config.html" c:run="concordion">xml configuration</a>. The configuration is built based on a
    specific message format. A message format would usually define the encoding, length, and order of every message
    element that comprises the message. Together with this configuration the framework provides the APIs to build the
    message codec. The <a href="codec/Codec.html" c:run="concordion">message codec</a> can then be used during the
    lifespan of the application and is designed to be thread safe.
